# üìÖ Java Exercise: Month Management with ArrayList and HashSet

## üìå Description

  ###  Exercise 1
  
  This project involves creating a class called `Month` with a `name` attribute, which stores the name of the month. The following tasks must be performed:
  
  1. Create 11 `Month` objects (one for each month, **except "August"**).
  2. Store these objects in an `ArrayList` in the correct order.
  3. Insert the **"August"** month in its correct position (after July).
  4. Convert the `ArrayList` into a `HashSet` to avoid duplicates.
  5. Iterate through the list using:
   - A `for-each` loop
   - An `Iterator`
  
  This exercise is useful for practicing with collections (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`), overriding methods such as `equals()` and `hashCode()`, and understanding how data structures work in Java.
  
  ###  Exercise 2
  
  This exercise focuses on working with lists in Java using `ArrayList` and the `ListIterator` class. The goal is to:
  
  1. Create and populate a list with elements.
  2. Create a second list.
  3. Insert into this second list the elements from the first list, **in reverse order**.
  4. To achieve this, a `ListIterator` object will be used to traverse the first list from end to start.
  
  This exercise is ideal for understanding the use of `ListIterator`, list manipulation, and how to reverse the contents of a collection in Java.
  
  ###  Exercise 3
  
  This project is a Java program that runs a quiz game about world capitals. The program reads a `countries.txt` file containing a list of countries and their capitals, and stores this information in a `HashMap`. Then, it prompts the user for their name and displays 10 random countries, one by one, asking the user to enter the corresponding capital.
  
  For each correct answer, the user earns one point. After the 10 questions, the user's name and total score are saved in a file called `categories.txt`.
